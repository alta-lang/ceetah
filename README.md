# Ceetah
(pronounced "see-tah")
C source code generation. Pure awesomeness. Play around with a C AST and then generate C code from it.

Originally created for Alta, but it has been decoupled from Alta and doesn't depend on it in any way. Therefore,
Ceetah should also be pretty useful for anyone looking to mess around with a C AST.
